Forked from https://github.com/mpetroff/kindle-weather-display

This repo will contain some modifications done to the script in order to handle Celsius
and a server that does not support python or the other apps required.

/!\Work in Progress/!\

TODO:
 - Support Celsius
 - Move over to PHP
 - Support other locations
 
DONE:
 - Application turns on usbnet before running
 - Run as Kite application instead of "on-boot" (my kindle used to get stuck in boot loops since the framework didn't want to be killed so early)
 - Dirtily removing reliance on cron, by simply running inside a loop (yes... hate me...)

NOT WORKING YET, but WORKING ON IT:
 - Contents of Server folder
